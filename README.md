# DesignPatternsProject - Insurance Company
one of my projects in the course of "Design Patterns", the mission was to build a creative UI for "insurance company" while writing the code with 1-3 design patterns that we learn in the course. 
in this project 3 design patterns were used:
1- Singleton: (for connection DB)
2- Data Access object: (for get and set data from DB)
3- Fa√ßade(mylogger class and call his function at main class)
